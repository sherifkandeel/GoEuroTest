# GoEuroTest
The test for applying to GoEuro position as Java Developer

Notes: 
- The coding was done in java SE 1.7 using IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.4 IDE on Windows 8.1 OS.
- The Design follows certain patterns of object oriented programming, but doesn't go too deep into them because of the nature of the program being not too difficult to directly implement.
- The Design follows guidelines of TDD (Test Driven Development) by creatring Junit tests for most of the classes. again, I didn't go very deep into test because of the app being simple.
- The Excutable Jar is located at out\artifacts\GoEuroTest_jar\GoEuroTest.jar and can be run using the command: 
  java -jar GoEuroTest.jar "City_name"  
  %where "city name" is the name of the desired city inside quotes.
- The output file will be generated next to the .jar file and is labeled "output.csv"
- The output file is UTF-8 BOM formatted for cities that doesn't use traditional characters.
